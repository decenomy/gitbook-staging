# Coin Selection

This menu has a dynamic result according to what is installed in the system.

If the coin masternode is not installed, it will prompt to install it, as can be seen in the following picture.

**#Picture Script\_20\_coin\_selection**

The installation process of the masternodes will display information about the current step. It is unlikely that the installation will get stuck, even though the screen may appear frozen or the process may seem to have stopped. It is advisable to wait for some time before aborting the process abruptly.

For reference, the complete automated process is presented in the picture below.

Once the installation is completed the coin selection screen for installation will not be available anymore and the screen of coin selection will now be this one:

**#Picture Script\_22\_coin\_selection**

Moving forward in the script, everything is related to the coin that was selected on the Main Menu. In this case, for example, it is Sapphire.
