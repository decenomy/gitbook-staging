# DECENOMY Multinode Script

This script was created to manage all the coins related to DECENOMY, making it easy to handle masternode multinode installations and maintenance. With this tool, it's possible to:

* Easily manage the masternodes of multiple coins in each system
* Follow the state of the wallet
* Check masternode status with explorer
* Conduct maintenance tasks such as wallet updates, bootstraps, and connection management.

The script will always have the latest wallet coin releases available as soon as they are released on each Github repo, which comes in handy and avoids the need for a new release of the script each time

### Install and launch

To install and run the script for the first time, please copy and paste the following command into your terminal prompt:

`wget -q https://github.com/decenomy/mnscript && bash decenomy.sh`

After the first launch, the script will convert the `decenomy.sh` file into an executable file named decenomy. Therefore, the user can simply enter the following command in the terminal prompt to launch the script next time:

`./decenomy`

This aligns with our commitment to providing a simple and user-friendly experience with this tool.
