# Main Menu

\#Picture of main screen

On this first screen, three distinct operations can be performed.

* **Select the coin to use**
* **Update the script**
* **Check what coins we have installed on the system we are running this tool**

### Coins to use

Each coin is referenced by a number so that it can be used. Just enter the number assigned to each coin in the prompt below and press the enter key.

### Update the script

This option can be used in case of a script update.

The script will assist the user by reading the latest version presented on Github and the version currently installed in the system (the version in use). The user will then be prompted to decide whether to proceed with the upgrade.

### Coins Installed

This feature provides an easy and fast way to determine which coin wallets have already been installed in the system through previous actions using this script and its own environment basis.
